School project where I improved my OOP skills including enheritance management, operator overloading and STL libraries usage. I built a map as a matrix, placed a treasure random on the map and starting from the corners of the matrix, the four explorers moved deterministically, trying to find the treasure.Â  The game stops when the treasure is found or all the explorers are blocked.
